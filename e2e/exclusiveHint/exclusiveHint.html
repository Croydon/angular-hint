  <div id="test">
    This is a test div that the controller will attempt to remove. Such manipulation
    of the DOM will cause ng-hint-dom to log a message if it is loaded correctly
    by the ng-hint-exclude tag. Only ng-hint-directives is listed in the ng-hint-exclude. Therefore,
    all other modules should be loaded.
  </div>

  <div id="directiveTest" ng-cick="">
    This is another test div that uses a mispelled directive. If ng-hint-directives was
    loaded, a message would be logged. However, the ng-hint-exclude excludes 'directives', so there
    should be no message about this error.

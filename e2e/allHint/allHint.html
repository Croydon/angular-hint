  <div id="test">
    This is a test div that the controller will attempt to remove. Such manipulation
    of the DOM will cause ng-hint-dom to log a message if it is loaded correctly
    by the ng-hint tag. Including the ng-hint tag with no parameters should include all the modules.
  </div>

  <div id="directiveTest" ng-cick="">
    This is another test div that uses a mispelled directive. If ng-hint-directives is correctly
    loaded, a message would be logged.
